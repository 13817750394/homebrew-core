If it's a `brew cask` problem please file this issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/caskroom/homebrew-cask/new. If it's a tap (e.g. Homebrew/homebrew-php) problem please file this issue at the tap.
- [ ] Ran `brew update` and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Ran `brew doctor`, fixed all issues and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Ran `brew gist-logs <formula>` (where `<formula>` is the name of the formula that failed) and included the output link?
- [ ] If `brew gist-logs` didn't work: ran `brew config` and `brew doctor` and included their output with your issue?
